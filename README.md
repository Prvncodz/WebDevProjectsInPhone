# 💻 Web Development Projects (Built Entirely on Mobile)

Welcome to my journey into **web development**, where every project you see here has been created and uploaded using **only my mobile phone**.

I don’t have a PC yet.  
I don’t wait for the perfect setup.  
I just **show up, code, and build** — no excuses.
